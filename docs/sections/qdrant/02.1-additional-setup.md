## Complete the setup

To complete the template setup, please run the following command in a terminal, at the root of the project:

```bash
./scripts/setup-template.sh qdrant
```

### Preparing the environment

<div data-visible="$$proxy$$">

We have deployed an Open AI proxy service for you, so you can use it to work on this workshop locally before deploying anything to Azure.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project, and add the following content:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_URL=$$proxy$$
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

</div>

<div data-hidden="$$proxy$$">

You first need to deploy an Azure Open AI service to use the OpenAI API.

Before moving to the next section, go to the **Azure setup** section (either on the left or using the "hamburger" menu depending of your device) to deploy the necessary resources and create your `.env` file needed.

After you completed the Azure setup, come back here to continue the workshop.

At this point you should have a `.env` file at the root of the project. Within that file, replace the line:

```
QDRANT_URL="<some_url>"
```

With:
  
```
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333"
```

</div>
