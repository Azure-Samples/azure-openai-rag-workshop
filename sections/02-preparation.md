## Preparation

Before diving into development, let's set up your project environment. This includes:

- Creating a new project on GitHub based on a template
- Using a prepared dev container environment on either [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [VS Code with Dev Containers extension](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) (or a manual install of the needed tools)

### Creating your project

1. Open [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-openai-rag-workshop)
2. Click the **Fork** button and click on **Create fork** to create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

Once the fork is created, select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab and click on **Create Codespaces on main**.

This will initialize a development container with all necessary tools pre-installed. Once it's ready, you have everything you need to start coding. Wait a few minutes after the UI is loaded to ensure everything is ready, as some tasks will be triggered after everything is fully loaded, such as the installation of the npm packages with `npm install`.

#### [optional] Local Development with the dev container

If you prefer working on your local machine, you can also run the dev container on your machine. If you're fine with using Codespaces, you can skip directly to the next section.


1. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the [Dev Containers extension](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) installed.

> You can learn more about Dev Containers in [this video series](https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/beginners-series-to-dev-containers/). You can also [check the website](https://containers.dev) and [the specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec).

2. In GitHub website, select the **Code** button, then the **Local** tab and copy your repository url.

3. Clone your forked repository and then open the folder in VS Code:

   ```bash
   git clone <your_repository_url>
   ```

3. In VS Code, use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Command+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the **command palette** and type **Reopen in Container**.

   *Alt text: Screenshot of VS Code showing the "Reopen in Container" command.*

The first time it will take some time to download and setup the container image, meanwhile you can go ahead and read the next sections.

Once the container is ready, you will see "Dev Container: OpenAI Workshop" in the bottom left corner of VSCode:

#### [optional] Working locally without the dev container

If you want to work locally without using a dev container, you need to clone the project and install the following tools:
