# ðŸ¤– azure-openai-rag-workshop

In this workshop, we will build a chatbot based on OpenAI language models and implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. 
<!-- Finally, we will deploy everything on Azure with a CI/CD pipeline. -->

This workshop exists in different variants:

#### Node.js

You'll use [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) to create a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) service that leverage [OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/) and [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/) to build a chatbot that will answer questions based on a corpus of documents, as well as a website to test it.

- ðŸ‘‰ [**See the workshop using Node.js + Azure AI Search**](https://aka.ms/ws/openai-rag): we will use [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/) to index and search the documents.

- ðŸ‘‰ [**See the workshop using Node.js + Qdrant**](https://aka.ms/ws/openai-rag-qdrant): we will use [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) to index and search the documents.

#### Java

You'll use [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) to create a [Java](https://openjdk.org/) service that leverage [OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/) and [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) to build a chatbot that will answer questions based on a corpus of documents, as well as a website to test it.

- ðŸ‘‰ [**See the workshop using Quarkus + Qdrant**](https://aka.ms/ws/openai-rag-quarkus): we will use [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) to index and search the documents.

## How deploy to Azure

Before deploying to Azure, you need to install the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). Once you're ready, run the following commands:

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

This commands will first ask you to log in into Azure. Then it will provison the Azure resources, package the services and deploy them to Azure.
